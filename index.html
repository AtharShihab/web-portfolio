          You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But
          nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and
          mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
          Development Hero.

          They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
          developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it.
          And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
